# ProgrEssen

## What

A playground for building food-related progress bars using German (Essen) foods and drinks:
 - Beer / Bier (current)
 - Sausage / Wurst (later)
 - Asparagus / Spargel (later)
 - Wine / Wein (later)

 ## Why

While working on a German trivia app, I found that I get bored of things that are out of the box. Sure, they're convenient, but visually yawn inducing. While I continue on the other app, I wanted a place to experiment with other ways of showing progress. 

These are mostly pure CSS images, so to prevent these from breaking the other app, they are built here to maaaaybe find their new home over in the app.

## How

Using Vite + React and pure CSS.

Started on Codepen but I was getting buggy results unless I used "Debug". Also, having these on their own app will make moving them to the app easier than converting from Codepen.

# React + Vite Mumbo Jumbo

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
